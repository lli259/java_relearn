Access Modifiers

class:
public:	The class is accessible by any other class	
default:	The class is only accessible by classes in the same package. 


attributes, methods and constructors:

public:	The code is accessible for all classes	
private:	The code is only accessible within the declared class	
default:	The code is only accessible in the same package.
protected:	The code is accessible in the same package and subclasse in the Inheritance relation. 


Non-Access Modifiers
classes
final:	The class cannot be inherited by other classes
abstract:	The class cannot be used to create objects

attributes and methods
final:	Attributes and methods cannot be overridden/modified
static: Attributes and methods belongs to the class, rather than an object
abstract:	Can only be used in an abstract class, and can only be used on methods. 
          The method does not have a body, for example abstract void run();. 
          The body is provided by the subclass (inherited from). 
transient: Attributes and methods are skipped when serializing the object containing them
synchronized: Methods can only be accessed by one thread at a time
volatile: The value of an attribute is not cached thread-locally, and is always read from the "main memory"
