/*

In Java, there are different types of variables, for example:

String - stores text, such as "Hello". String values are surrounded by double quotes
int - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123
float - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99
char - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes
boolean - stores values with two states: true or false

*/

/*
Primitive data types - includes byte, short, int, long, float, double, boolean and char
Non-primitive data types - String, Arrays and Classes

Non-primitive types can be used to call methods to perform certain operations, while primitive types cannot.
A primitive type starts with a lowercase letter, while non-primitive types starts with an uppercase letter.
The size of a primitive type depends on the data type, while non-primitive types have all the same size.

Size:
byte	1 byte	Stores whole numbers from -128 to 127
short	2 bytes	Stores whole numbers from -32,768 to 32,767
int	4 bytes	Stores whole numbers from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647
long	8 bytes	Stores whole numbers from -9,223,372,036,854,775.808 to 9,223.372,036,854,775,808
float	4 bytes	Stores fractional numbers from 3.4e−038 to 3.4e+038. Sufficient for storing 6 to 7 decimal digits
double	8 bytes	Stores fractional numbers from 1.7e−308 to 1.7e+038. Sufficient for storing 15 decimal digits
boolean	1 byte	Stores true or false values
char	2 bytes	Stores a single character/letter

// String starts with a uppercase, "S", as it is Non-primitive data type.

String name = "John";
System.out.println(name);

String firstName = "John ";
String lastName = "Doe";
String fullName = firstName + lastName;
System.out.println(fullName);



//int
int myNum = 15;
System.out.println(myNum);

int myNum;
myNum = 15;
System.out.println(myNum);
int x = 5;
int y = 6;
System.out.println(x + y);

int x = 5, y = 6, z = 50;
System.out.println(x + y + z);

byte myNum = 100;
short myNum = 5000;
int myNum = 15;
long myNum = 15000000000L;

//float
float myFloatNum = 5.99f;
double myNum = 19.99d;


//boolean
boolean myBool = true;

//char
char myLetter = 'D';
