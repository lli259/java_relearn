//An enum is a special "class" that represents a group of constants (unchangeable variables, like final variables).
//enum constant are public, static and final.
//Use enums when you have values that you know aren't going to change, like month days, days, colors, deck of cards, etc.

enum Level {
  LOW,
  MEDIUM,
  HIGH
}

Level myVar = Level.MEDIUM;


//enum inside class
public class MyClass { 
  enum Level {
    LOW,
    MEDIUM,
    HIGH
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) { 
    Level myVar = Level.MEDIUM; 
    System.out.println(myVar); 
  } 
}
//"MEDIUM"
